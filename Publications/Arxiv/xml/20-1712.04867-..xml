    <title>Nearly free curves and arrangements: a vector bundle point of view</title>
    <summary>  Many papers are devoted to study logarithmic sheaves associated to reduced
divisors, in particular logarithmic bundles associated to plane curves since
forty years in differential and algebraic topology or geometry. An interesting
family of these curves are the so-called free ones for which the associated
logarithmic sheaf is the direct sum of two line bundles. When the curve is a
finite set of distinct lines (i.e. a line arrangement), Terao conjectured
thirty years ago that its freeness depends only on its combinatorics. A lot of
efforts were done to prove it but at this time it is only proved up to 12
lines. If one wants to find a counter example to this conjecture a new family
of curves arises naturally: the nearly free curves introduced by Dimca and
Sticlaru. We prove here that the logarithmic bundle associated to a nearly free
curve possesses a minimal non zero section that vanishes on one single point
$P$, called jumping point, and that characterizes the bundle. Then we give a
precise description of the behaviour of $P$. In particular we show, based on
detailed examples, that the position of $P$ relatively to its corresponding
nearly free arrangement of lines may or may not be a combinatorial invariant,
depending on the chosen combinatorics.
