    <title>Rational fibered cubic fourfolds with nontrivial Brauer classes</title>
    <summary>  Some classes of cubic fourfolds are birational to fibrations over $P^2$,
where the fibers are rational surfaces. This relates strongly the rationality
of the cubic with the rationality of these surfaces over the function field of
$P^2$ and to the existence of rational sections of the fibration. It is an
interesting question to understand whether the existence of a rational section
is also necessary for the rationality of the cubic. Let $C_{18}$ denote the
divisor inside the moduli space of smooth cubic hypersurfaces in $P^5$ whose
general element is a smooth cubic containing an elliptic ruled surface
associated to a sextic del Pezzo fibration. Cubics in $C_{18}$ are rational
whenever the fibration has rational sections. By intersecting $C_{18}$ with the
divisors $C_{14}$, $C_{26}$ and $C_{38}$, whose elements are known to be
rational, we provide explicit description of these intersections and we exhibit
new examples of rational cubic fourfolds whose associated good sextic del Pezzo
fibration has no rational sections. We study also the divisor $C_{8}$, whose
general element is a cubic containing a plane. These cubics are birational to
quadric fibrations over $P^2$. Intersections between $C_8$ and the divisors
$C_{26}$, $C_{38}$ give us also new classes of smooth rational cubic fourfolds
whose associated quadric surface bundle doesn't have a rational section.
