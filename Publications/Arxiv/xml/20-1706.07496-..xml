    <title>Some algebraic aspects of mesoprimary decomposition</title>
    <summary>  Recent results of Kahle and Miller give a method of constructing primary
decompositions of binomial ideals by first constructing "mesoprimary
decompositions" determined by their underlying monoid congruences. Monoid
congruences (and therefore, binomial ideals) can present many subtle behaviors
that must be carefully accounted for in order to produce general results, and
this makes the theory complicated. In this paper, we examine their results in
the presence of a positive $A$-grading, where certain pathologies are avoided
and the theory becomes more accessible. Our approach is algebraic: while key
notions for mesoprimary decomposition are developed first from a combinatorial
point of view, here we state definitions and results in algebraic terms, which
are moreover significantly simplified due to our (slightly) restricted setting.
In the case of toral components (which are well-behaved with respect to the
$A$-grading), we are able to obtain further simplifications under additional
assumptions. We also provide counterexamples to two open questions, identifying
(i) a binomial ideal whose hull is not binomial, answering a question of
Eisenbud and Sturmfels, and (ii) a binomial ideal $I$ for which
$I_\text{toral}$ is not binomial, answering a question of Dickenstein, Miller
and the first author.
