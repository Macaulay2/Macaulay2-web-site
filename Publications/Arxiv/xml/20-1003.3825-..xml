    <title>On the shape of a pure O-sequence</title>
    <summary>  An order ideal is a finite poset X of (monic) monomials such that, whenever M
is in X and N divides M, then N is in X. If all, say t, maximal monomials of X
have the same degree, then X is pure (of type t). A pure O-sequence is the
vector, h=(1,h_1,...,h_e), counting the monomials of X in each degree.
Equivalently, in the language of commutative algebra, pure O-sequences are the
h-vectors of monomial Artinian level algebras. Pure O-sequences had their
origin in one of Richard Stanley's early works in this area, and have since
played a significant role in at least three disciplines: the study of
simplicial complexes and their f-vectors, level algebras, and matroids. This
monograph is intended to be the first systematic study of the theory of pure
O-sequences. Our work, making an extensive use of algebraic and combinatorial
techniques, includes: (i) A characterization of the first half of a pure
O-sequence, which gives the exact converse to an algebraic g-theorem of Hausel;
(ii) A study of (the failing of) the unimodality property; (iii) The problem of
enumerating pure O-sequences, including a proof that almost all O-sequences are
pure, and the asymptotic enumeration of socle degree 3 pure O-sequences of type
t; (iv) The Interval Conjecture for Pure O-sequences (ICP), which represents
perhaps the strongest possible structural result short of an (impossible?)
characterization; (v) A pithy connection of the ICP with Stanley's matroid
h-vector conjecture; (vi) A specific study of pure O-sequences of type 2,
including a proof of the Weak Lefschetz Property in codimension 3 in
characteristic zero. As a corollary, pure O-sequences of codimension 3 and type
2 are unimodal (over any field); (vii) An analysis of the extent to which the
Weak and Strong Lefschetz Properties can fail for monomial algebras; (viii)
Some observations about pure f-vectors, an important special case of pure
O-sequences.
