    <title>Cubics in 10 variables vs. cubics in 1000 variables: Uniformity
  phenomena for bounded degree polynomials</title>
    <summary>  Hilbert famously showed that polynomials in n variables are not too
complicated, in various senses. For example, the Hilbert Syzygy Theorem shows
that the process of resolving a module by free modules terminates in finitely
many (in fact, at most n) steps, while the Hilbert Basis Theorem shows that the
process of finding generators for an ideal also terminates in finitely many
steps. These results laid the foundations for the modern algebraic study of
polynomials.
  Hilbert's results are not uniform in n: unsurprisingly, polynomials in n
variables will exhibit greater complexity as n increases. However, an array of
recent work has shown that in a certain regime---namely, that where the number
of polynomials and their degrees are fixed---the complexity of polynomials (in
various senses) remains bounded even as the number of variables goes to
infinity. We refer to this as Stillman uniformity, since Stillman's Conjecture
provided the motivating example. The purpose of this paper is to give an
exposition of Stillman uniformity, including: the circle of ideas initiated by
Ananyan and Hochster in their proof of Stillman's Conjecture, the followup
results that clarified and expanded on those ideas, and the implications for
understanding polynomials in many variables.
