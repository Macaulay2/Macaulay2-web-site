<h3>Some software distributions that refer to <i>Macaulay2</i></h3>

    <li>An old version of <i>Macaulay2</i> is an optional component of <a href="http://sage.scipy.org/sage/">Sage</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.texmacs.org/">TeXmacs</a>, a "what you see is what you get" editor based on TeX, which is being developed to
	    serve as a user interface for <i>Macaulay2</i> and other symbolic algebra programs by Joris van der Hoeven.</li>

<h3>Some news items that refer to <i>Macaulay2</i></h3>

<ul>
  <li>2006 Fields Medalist Andrei Okounkov mentions <i>Macaulay2</i> in 
    an <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200703/comm-fields-interviews.pdf">interview</a>:
    "This brings up many issues. I am not an expert, but I think we need a symbolic
    standard to make computer manipulations easier to document and verify. And with
    all due respect to the free market, perhaps we should not be dependent on
    commercial software here. An open-source project could, perhaps, find better
    answers to the obvious problems such as availability, bugs, backward
    compatibility, platform independence, standard libraries, etc. One can learn
    from the success of TEX and more specialized software like Macaulay2.  I do
    hope that funding agencies are looking into this."</li>

<h3><a name="papers"></a>Some papers that refer to <i>Macaulay2</i></h3>

<p>
  Many of the older citations to papers below were obtained using a a full text search
  at <a href="http://arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a> for "Macaulay2" or "Macaulay 2" but not "Cohen Macaulay 2".
  More recent searches search simply for "Macaulay2" in the text of the paper, which is now our preferred way to type the name.
  We are missing some of the results between 0908.2609 (2008 Sep) and 1110.4080 (2011 Oct), since
  we were tardy in trying to use the arxiv's full text search function, and there is a limit of 
  200 results; the results we have in that interval were obtained from google.
  See also <a href="http://swmath.org/software/537">http://swmath.org/software/537</a> for a list
  of papers referring to "Macaulay2" generated by searching Zentralblatt.
