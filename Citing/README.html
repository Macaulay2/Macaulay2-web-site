  If you cite <i>Macaulay2</i> in a paper, please send us a reference, and we'll add it to our list of publications.
  We recommend you use the following bibtex entry for citing <i>Macaulay2</i>.
</p>
<pre>        @Misc{M2,
          author = {Grayson, Daniel R. and Stillman, Michael E.},
          title = {Macaulay2, a software system for research in algebraic geometry},
          howpublished = {Available at \url{http://www2.macaulay2.com}}
        }</pre>
<p>
  The macro <tt>\url</tt> is provided by the hyperref macro package; to get it, add
<pre>          \usepackage{hyperref}</pre> to the preamble of your latex file,
or just remove it.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 100%;">
  Note: in October, 2009, we decided to refer uniformly to
  <i>Macaulay2</i> (with no internal space) instead of to <i>Macaulay 2</i>.
  You can help us find your preprints and papers that refer to it by doing the same.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to cite an existing <i>Macaulay2</i> package, you may use the package <i>PackageCitations</i>.  Here is
  an example of its use:
  <pre>
    i3 : loadPackage "PackageCitations"

    o3 = PackageCitations

    i5 : cite "IntegralClosure"

    o5 = @misc{IntegralClosureSource,
            title = {{IntegralClosure: A \emph{Macaulay2} package. Version~1.0}},
            author = {Amelia Taylor and David Eisenbud and Mike Stillman},
            howpublished = {A \emph{Macaulay2} package available at \url{https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/tree/master/M2/Macaulay2/packages}}
         }
</pre>
</p>
