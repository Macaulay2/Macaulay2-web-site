<p>
  <i>Macaulay2</i> for Microsoft Windows has been compiled
  under the 32 bit version of <a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, a system that provides
  Microsoft Windows with a high degree of compatibility with
  the <a href="http://gnu.org/">GNU operating system</a> (upon which
  GNU/Linux is based), which you will need in order to install and to
  run <i>Macaulay2</i>.
  Visit <a href="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</a> to download the
  program <tt>setup-x86.exe</tt> and to install Cygwin, if you haven't done so
  already.  The initial minimal installation takes 77MB, excluding the
  temporary download files, which can be manually deleted later; the
  final installation, including Macaulay2, emacs, and X Windows, takes
  572MB.
</p>

<p>
  You may use <tt>setup-x86.exe</tt> to install <i>Macaulay2</i> by telling it
  the location of our <a href="/Macaulay2/Repositories/cygwin/">Cygwin
  repository</a>.  It will download the needed file(s) and install any
  prerequisite packages that haven't yet been installed.  It is important to
  start <tt>setup-x86.exe</tt> with the full path to the public key
  file <a href="../../../PublicKeys/Macaulay2-key.data">Macaulay2-key.data</a>,
  which you should download and save, so it can use it to verify the
  signature attached to our <tt>setup.ini</tt> file.  
  Suppose you have downloaded and saved <tt>setup-x86.exe</tt> in the
  directory <tt>F:\foo\bar</tt>, and you have downloaded and
  saved <tt>Macaulay2-key.data</tt> in <tt>J:\goo\car</tt>.  Then the command
  would be:
</p>

<pre>F:\foo\bar\setup-x86 -K J:\goo\car\Macaulay2-key.data</pre> 

<p>
  Use the command above in a command prompt window, in a command prompt
  window running as an administrator, in the "Run" window, or in a shortcut
  that you create.  (The setup command presumably changes directories before
  looking for the specified key file, which is why the full path to the key
  file must be specified.  Inconvenient but true.)
</p>

<p>
  Here is the way to tell Cygwin's <tt>setup-x86</tt> program the location of
  the <i>Macaulay2</i> repository.  (You may tell it the first time you use
  it, or any subsequent time.)  After it downloads the list of mirror sites
  from cygwin.com, it displays a dialogue box entitled <em>Choose A Download
  Site</em>.  Add our site to the list of available sites by entering
</p>
<pre>http://macaulay2.com/Repositories/cygwin/</pre>
<p>
  in the box labelled <em>User URL</em> and pressing the <em>Add</em> button.
  Normally our site's domain name will then be highlighted, as will the
  domain name of the Cygwin mirror used for your initial installation of
  Cygwin.  If you see that only one download site is highlighted, then
  highlight a Cygwin mirror site geographically near you by clicking on it
  (all of the other names on the list are names of Cygwin mirror sites), and
  then highlight our site by clicking on it with the left button
  while <em>holding down the control key</em>, so that now you have both
  sites highlighted.  <em>Warning</em>: if you highlight just our site, then
  packages upon which <i>Macaulay2</i> depends may not be installed for you
  by the Cygwin setup program, and our program will not run.  The next time
  you run the Cygwin setup program, simply leave these two mirror sites
  highlighted, and all will be well.
</p>

<p>
  Now press the <em>Next</em> button and examine the <em>Select Packages</em>
  dialogue box.  Initially the "View" is set to to "Category", but pushing
  the button changes it to "Full".  Enter the first four letters or so of
  "Macaulay2" into the "Search" box and the packages <b>Macaulay2</b>
  and <b>Macaulay2-icons</b> will appear; the packages have independent
  version numbers.  Installing the latter package is equivalent to installing
  the most recent version of the former, together with convenient shortcuts
  for starting up X Windows, emacs, and Macaulay2 with a single click.  Press
  the spinning arrow symbol under "New" for the desired package to replace
  the desired action (initially set to "Skip") by the desired version number
  of Macaulay2.  After you press the <em>Next</em> button, the package will
  be installed, along with the other 87 packages it needs, including emacs
  and X Windows.
</p>

<p>
  Assuming you installed the package <b>Macaulay2-icons</b> in the previous step, you may now
  start up X Windows, emacs, and Macaulay2 by clicking on the shortcut on your desktop, or in the start
  menu folder called <b>Macaulay2</b>, whose name is <b>XWin + emacs + M2</b>.  If X Windows is
  already running, then use the shortcut whose name is <b>emacs + M2 on 0</b>.  An emacs window should
  eventually pop up with Macaulay2 running in a command interaction buffer.
</p>

<p>
  Installing <i>Macaulay2</i> as described above will set all paths appropriately and make
  the <i>Macaulay2</i> emacs files visible to emacs, so users will not have to run the "setup()" function
  in <i>Macaulay2</i>.  However, if you run the "setupEmacs()" function in <i>Macaulay2</i>, then code
  will be added to your emacs init file that arranges for the <em>f12</em> function key to be bound to
  the emacs "M2" function, which starts <i>Macaulay2</i> running in an interactive emacs buffer.  One way
  to run the new code in your emacs init file is to restart emacs, after which the <em>f12</em> key in
  emacs should work.  If you don't run "setupEmacs()" in <i>Macaulay2</i>, you can always
  start <i>Macaulay2</i> in emacs with the keystrokes <tt>M-x M2</tt> in emacs.
</p>

<p>
  Users new to emacs should spend some time becoming accustomed to it.  A good place to start learning
  how to use emacs is with the Emacs Tutorial, which can be accessed after starting emacs.

<p>
  Here are some solutions for some common problems that occur when running Cygwin.
</p>

<ul>

  <li><em><b>setup-x86.exe</b> keeps offering to make cygwin shortcuts on my
      desktop, even though I don't want them.</em>  Solution: add <b>-n</b> to the 
      command line.</li>

  <li><em>I typed the URL of the Macaulay2 cygwin repository incorrectly,
      but there seems to be no way to edit it or to remove it from the 
      list of download sites known to <b>setup-x86.exe</b>.</em>
      Solution: Unhighlight that download site in the list and
      exit the program.  The next time, it won't be there.</li>

  <li><em>emacs can't interrupt Macaulay2 with C-c C-c</em>: Cause: a bug in the way emacs sends
    interrupts to subjobs.  Solution: send a C-c character to Macaulay2 with C-q C-c RETURN.  A future
    version of emacs will address the problem, at least for interruption of loops, but perhaps not for 
    interruption of printing.
  </li>

  <li><em>emacs can't start M2 for want of resources</em>:  Cause: unclear; solution: try this:
    shut down all Cygwin processes, start up a Windows shell, navigate to C:/cygwin/bin, run "ash.exe",
    and run "./rebaseall -v".</li>

  <li><em>M2 runs a program and gets this message: "linked dll data write copy failed"</em>:  Cause: unclear;
    try this: shut down all Cygwin processes, start up a Windows shell, navigate to C:/cygwin/bin, run "ash.exe",
    and run "./rebaseall -v".  Alternatively, refer to <a href="http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.using.html#faq.using.bloda">this list of
      programs that might interfere with cygwin</a>, and try shutting down any of them that are running on your machine.</li>


  <li><em>It's hard to locate files from within <i>Macaulay2</i> or emacs.</em>  Cause: Cygwin and
    Microsoft Windows have different roots for their file systems.  Solution: within a Cygwin program,
    such as M2 or emacs, the root of drive C (for example) can be accessed as "/cygdrive/c".  Within a
    Microsoft Windows program, such as the explorer or firefox, the root of Cygwin's file system is
    visible as "C:/cygwin", if Cygwin was installed in the usual location.  The program <tt>cygpath</tt>
    can be used to translate paths in either direction.
  </li>

  <li><em>I ask <b>setup-x86.exe</b> to install something, and it doesn't install it.</em>  A good way to see
    what <b>setup</b> will install in the final step, before going there, is to press the "View" button
    in the upper right hand corner until the text to the right of it says "Pending".  Then the list below
    will consist of those Cygwin packages it intends to install or upgrade.</li>

</ul>
