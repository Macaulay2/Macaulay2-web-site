<h2>Instructions for installing Macaulay2 with root access</h2>

<p>
  Prepare for installing Macaulay2 (with apt-get, gdebi-gtk, or the
  Synaptic Package Manager) by adding the following line to the file
  <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>, suitably modified as described in the table below:
</p>

<pre>
    deb http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Repositories/Ubuntu XXXX main
</pre>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Operating system</th>

<p>
  (Double check that you have the right replacement for "XXXX" by observing that it appears already on many other lines in that file.)
</p>

<p>
  There are various ways to add that line to that file:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use the "Synaptic Package Manager", which can be started from the
    "System/Administration" menu or the "Desktop/Administration" menu.  (You
    may also start it with the command "sudo synaptic" in a shell window.)
    Pull down the "Settings" menu, and select "Repositories".  That will open up
    a window called "Software Sources".  Now, depending
    on which version you have, do one of the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
	If you see a tab labelled "Other Software" or "Third Party Software",
	click on it, then click on "Add", and add the entry.  If you make a
	mistake, be prepared to use an editor to edit the file to correct it.
	If two entries are created, remove or un-check the one corresponding
	to the source code (since we don't provide those).  For "Type", select
	"Binary", for "URI" insert "http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Repositories/Ubuntu",
	for "Distribution" insert the replacement for "XXXX" introduced above,
	and for "Components" insert "main".
      </li>
      <li>
	If you see a tab labelled "Installation Media", then click on it, then
	click on "Add" and then "Custom", and add the entry.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the "Software Sources" program, which can be started from the
    "System/Administration" menu, or the "Software Properties" program, which
    can be started from the "Desktop/Administration" menu.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the command "<tt>sudo emacs /etc/apt/sources.list</tt>" to edit the file and add that line.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alternatively, use the following command, as root, (with XXXX replaced, as described
    above) to add the line to a separate file where apt-get can find it.
<pre>
    echo 'deb http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Repositories/Ubuntu XXXX main' >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/macaulay2.list
</pre>
    To get a command shell as root, the following command can be used:
<pre>
    sudo bash
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Another thing you should do (now) is to download and save the public key
  file <a href="../../../PublicKeys/Macaulay2-key">Macaulay2-key</a>, so you
  can add it to the key ring used for upgrading the system.  This will allow
  the system to verify the signatures attached to the Macaulay2 distribution
  files.  To add it to the key ring using the graphical user interface, access
  the "Software Sources" window (or program), as mentioned above, but this time
  select the "Authentication" tab.  Click on the "Import Key File..." button,
  and select the previously downloaded public key file, <tt>Macaulay2-key</tt>.
  To add it to the key ring manually use the command "<tt>sudo apt-key add Macaulay2-key</tt>".
</p>

<p>
  Another source for the key is from <a href="http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0x53F8BD99F40DCB31">keys.gnupg.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively, the downloading and installation of
  the key can be accomplished by the following single command
</p>
<pre>
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-key CD9C0E09B0C780943A1AD85553F8BD99F40DCB31
</pre>

<p>
  Now, using the "Synaptic Package Manager", reload the package lists from the
  repositories by clicking on the "Reload" button, and then click on the
  Mathematics (Math) section.  You should see "macaulay2" on the list,
  available for download: click on it.  It will add both "macaulay2" and
  "macaulay2-common" to the list of packages to be installed.  (Behind the
  scenes, the package manager will
  consult <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Repositories/Ubuntu/dists/">our
  Ubuntu repository</a>.)
</p>

<p>
  Later upgrades to Macaulay2 will become available to you almost
  automatically.  You can periodically run the Synaptic Package Manager and
  check for updates by clicking on "Reload" and then on "Mark all Upgrades".
  Alternatively, when an orange starburst icon is occasionally displayed in
  your task bar indicating that updates are available from Ubuntu headquarters,
  you may click on the icon to activate the Update Manager, and then click on
  "Check" to download any new package information from the software channels,
  including the Macaulay2 repository.  If an update of Macaulay2 is
  available, it will be displayed at the bottom of the list, after the
  Important Security Updates and the Recommended Updates, among the Other
  Updates.  Press "Install Updates" to have it installed, along with the
  others.  (If you have not installed the Macaulay2 public key file as
  described above, then our update will be listed as "Not authenticated", and
  the "list of changes" will not be available.)
</p>

<p>
  Another way to install Macaulay2, after that line is added to
  /etc/apt/sources.list, is with these command lines.
</p>

<pre>
	sudo apt-get update -q
	sudo apt-get install -y -q macaulay2
</pre>

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   <b>Warning:</b> if you get something like the following error messages: -->
<!-- </p> -->
<!-- <pre>        $ M2 -->
<!--         M2: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found (required by M2) -->
<!--         M2: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: no version information available (required by M2) -->
<!--         M2: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: no version information available (required by M2) -->
<!--         M2: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: no version information available (required by M2) -->
<!--         $ </pre> -->
<!-- <p> -->
<!--   then it means that we have compiled M2 on a more recent version of Ubuntu -->
<!--   than you have installed on your machine.  To fix it, you can "upgrade" to -->
<!--   the latext ubuntu release (for example, Macaulay2 1.3.1 requires ubuntu 9.10 -->
<!--   or higher), or you can compile Macaulay2 -->
<!--   from <a href="../../SourceCode/">source code</a>. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<p>
  The preferred way to run Macaulay2 is with emacs, but the installation
  procedure described above doesn't teach emacs how to do that.  So, after
  Macaulay2 is successfully installed as described above, the first thing you
  should do is to run M2 and to issue the Macaulay2
  command <b>setupEmacs()</b>.  That will ensure that the next time you start
  emacs, it knows how to edit *.m2 files, and it knows that when you press the
  f12 key, it should start Macaulay2 running in an interactive buffer.
</p>

<p>
  If the procedure above doesn't work for you, then you may install the package
  files manually with <b>dpkg</b> (they all have names of the
  form <b>*.deb</b>).  They come in pairs, one containing the architecture
  dependent files (in this directory), and one of
  the <a href="../../Common/">the common files</a> containing the architecture
  independent files and having "common" in the name.

<h2>Instructions for installing Macaulay2 without root access</h2>

<p>
  You may <a href="../InstallingFromTarFiles.txt">install from a tar file</a>,
  if we have provided one above.  Alternatively, here is the procedure for
  unpacking a *.deb file yourself, which you may use on the two *.deb files
  mentioned above.  (One of them provides the files that depend on the
  architecture and operating system, and the other provides the files that have
  the same form in all distrubtions.)  We assume the *.deb file is
  called <tt>/tmp/Macaulay2-1.6-AAA-Linux-Ubuntu-XXX.deb</tt>, which you have
  chosen because you have version XXX of Ubuntu.  Here "AAA" denotes your
  computer's architecture.
</p>

<pre>
     mkdir foo
     cd foo
     ar x /tmp/Macaulay2-1.6-AAA-Linux-Ubuntu-XXX.deb data.tar.gz
     tar xzf data.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
  The result will be a directory tree named "usr", which can be moved and
  renamed at will.  After moving it, run the program bin/M2 contained within,
  and run the "setup()" command to set up your standard init files, as
  described elsewhere.  Then the directory "foo" and the file "data.tar.gz" in
  it can be removed.

<h2>Instructions for installing Macaulay2 from Personal Package Archive</h2>

<p>
  An alternate method for installing the latest version of Macaulay2
  in Ubuntu is to use the
  <a href="https://launchpad.net/~macaulay2/+archive/ubuntu/macaulay2">PPA</a>
  (Personal Package Archive):
</p>

<pre>
     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:macaulay2/macaulay2
     sudo apt install macaulay2
</pre>
