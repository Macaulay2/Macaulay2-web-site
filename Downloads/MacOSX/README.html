There are now two ways to install <i>Macaulay2</i> under Mac OS X:
<ul>
  <li>installing using <b>brew</b></li>
  <li>downloading a disk image</li>
</ul>

We describe both of them below.

<h2>Installing using brew</h2>

<p>
  Mahrud Sayrafi has created
  a <a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap">homebrew tap</a>
  containing a binary distribution of <i>Macaulay2</i>, which makes
  installation of <i>Macaulay2</i> easy, once you've installed "brew" according
  to the instructions at <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>.
  Install <i>Macaulay2</i> with the following command.
</p>

<pre>
  brew install Macaulay2/tap/M2
</pre>

<p>
  You will now find the program <tt>M2</tt> in the
  directory <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> (if you've installed homebrew
  in <tt>/usr/local</tt>, as they recommend), and it can be run with the
  command <tt>/usr/local/bin/M2</tt>.  You may need to use this long form once
  to evaluate <tt>setup()</tt>, in case the command <tt>M2</tt> runs a
  previously installed version; the settings take effect the next time you 
  log in.  (If you don't want <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> added to your PATH
  by <tt>setup</tt>, then run the alternative command
  <tt>$(brew --prefix M2)/bin/M2</tt> instead.
  The result will be that something like <tt>/usr/local/opt/macaulay2/bin</tt>
  is added to your PATH.)
</p>

<p>
  If there are any problems with this procedure, please check the "issues" at
  <a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap/issues">homebrew-tap/issues</a>,
  and create a new one if you don't see a discussion of the problem you're having.
</p>

<h2>Downloading a disk image</h2>

<p>
  Here are the downloadable disk images and their corresponding signature files (see <a href="../../PublicKeys/">PublicKeys</a>);
  the name of the file incorporates the architecture and Mac OS version number.  Starting with Macaulay2 version 1.18,
  we no longer make these disk images, since the homebrew installation (above) is available.
