There are now two ways to install <i>Macaulay2</i> under Mac OS X:
<ul>
  <li>installing using <b>brew</b></li>
  <li>downloading a disk image</li>
</ul>

We describe both of them below.

<h2>Installing using brew</h2>

<p>
  Mahrud Sayrafi has created
  a <a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap">homebrew tap</a>
  containing a binary distribution of <i>Macaulay2</i>, which makes
  installation of <i>Macaulay2</i> easy, once you've installed "brew" according
  to the instructions at <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>.  Here are the
  steps.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>In case you have previously installed "flint" using "brew", perhaps as
    part of the process of compiling <i>Macaulay2</i> from source code, remove
    it with the following command.  (<i>Macaulay2</i> needs version 2.6.3 of
    flint, but "brew" installs version 2.7.0 by default.)
    <pre>
      brew remove flint
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now install <i>Macaulay2</i> with this command.
    <pre>
      brew install Macaulay2/tap/M2
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  You will now find the program <tt>M2</tt> in the
  directory <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> (if you've installed homebrew
  in <tt>/usr/local</tt>, as they recommend), and it can be run with the
  command <tt>/usr/local/bin/M2</tt>.  You may need to use this long form once
  to evaluate <tt>setup()</tt>, in case the command <tt>M2</tt> runs a
  previously installed version; the settings take effect the next time you 
  log in.  (If you don't want <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> added to your PATH
  by <tt>setup</tt>, then run the alternative command
  <tt>$(brew --prefix M2)/bin/M2</tt> instead.)
  The result will be that something like <tt>/usr/local/opt/macaulay2/bin</tt>
  is added to your PATH.)
</p>

<p>
  If there are any problems with this procedure, please check the "issues" at
  <a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/homebrew-tap/issues">homebrew-tap/issues</a>,
  and create a new one if you don't see a discussion of the problem you're having.

<h2>Downloading a disk image</h2>

<p>
  Here are the downloadable disk images and their corresponding signature files (see <a href="../../PublicKeys/">PublicKeys</a>);
  the name of the file incorporates the architecture and Mac OS version number.
