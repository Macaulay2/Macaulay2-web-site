<p>
  However, the best way to get the source code is with a client
  for <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, the source code control system we
  use.  To get (or to view) the latest version of the source code, possibly
  with bugs, visit
  <a href="https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2">https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2</a>
  and press the "ZIP" or "Clone" buttons.  Alternatively, run this command in a
  new directory:
</p>

<pre>
        git clone https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2
</pre>

<p>
  The result will be a directory named M2 containing the source code directory
  tree of <em>Macaulay2</em>, checked out from the branch called "master".
  Other branches are used for development of numbered releases (e.g.,
  "release-1.6"), and there are tags that label stable versions of those
  branches (e.g., "release-1.6-stable-20130514").
</p>

<p>
  After getting the source code as described above, and assuming the directory
  is now named "M2", you may build <em>Macaulay2</em> from it as follows.  First do
</p>

<pre>
	 cd M2
	 make
</pre>

<p>
  That initial step will create the "configure" script.
</p>

<p>
  Then do something like
</p>

<pre>
	 cd BUILD
	 mkdir foo
	 cd foo
	 ../../configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-download
	 make
	 make install
</pre>

<p>
  to compile and install the code.  You may replace /usr/local by $HOME/local,
  for example, if you don't have root privileges.  You may replace "foo" by a
  directory anywhere, provided you adjust the path to "configure" appropriately.
</p>

<p>
  The command
</p>

<pre>
	 ../../configure --help
</pre>

<p>
  will explain the options can be passed to the configure script.
</p>

<p>
  You may refer to the file
</p>

<pre>
	 ./INSTALL
</pre>

<p>
  for some more detailed instructions about this installation.
